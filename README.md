# RILEY BARABASH: Self, Systems, Scale.

My name is Riley. Engineer of self-state, designer of systems, and architect of precision at scale. I take an interest in actualizing the unknown.

## Development

### Git Hooks

Hooks can be bypassed in emergencies:

-   `git commit --no-verify` - Skip all checks
-   `SKIP=pre-commit git commit` - Skip specific check

Use sparingly - these bypass important quality checks!
