## Marketing Plan

### Drayton Rally

-   Even for non-purchasers, capture contact details to send an update after the event.
-   Start with a story: "My Dad loves boating, and I love running, and I thought - what better way to capture a memory than by printing the route on a canvas to hang in your home?".
-   Offer the first one for free so that you can say someone bought it. Talk about how that person plans to use it. Mention that you're buying multiple for yourself, and how you plan to send them to others as a gift.
-   If someone says no, agree with them first, then handle the objection. Never argue with a no - side with them instead and solve their problem.
